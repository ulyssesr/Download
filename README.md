This PHP script forces a file to be downloaded instead of being played, especially in the case of a video files in the way some browsers behave. This script uses a file called dl.php to force a download. 

How to use. Just create a download URL use the dl.php?file=image.png. See example below.

```
<a href="./dl.php?file=image.png">Download</a>
```
